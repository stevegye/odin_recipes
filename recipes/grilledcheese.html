  <h6>Hummus Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h6>
  <p>My sister-in-law served us this hummus grilled cheese sandwich after seeing it posted on the Dallas Arboretum
    bulletin
    board.</p>
  <p>I thought it was too good not to share, and it's a perfect choice for Meatless Monday. We especially enjoy rye or
    sourdough for this sandwich.</p>
  <h2>Ingredient</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
    <li>½ cup coarsely chopped sweet onion</li>
    <li>4 slices bread</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons mayonnaise</li>
    <li>⅔ cup roasted red pepper hummus, such as ATHENOS®</li>
    <li>½ cup shredded Swiss cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a skillet. Sauté mushrooms and onions until tender, about 5 minutes; remove from
      skillet, and set skillet aside.
    </li>
    <li>Spread mayonnaise on 4 slices of bread. Turn the slices mayo side down, and evenly spread hummus on all 4
      slices. On
      only 2 of those slices, evenly layer mushroom-onion mixture followed by Swiss cheese. Top with remaining 2 bread
      slices
      with mayonnaise side up. (To clarify, each of the 2 sandwiches will have hummus on the top and bottom of the
      sandwich,
      with cheese and mushroom mixture in the center).</li>
    <li>Reheat the skillet over medium heat; place sandwiches mayonnaise side down in the skillet, and cook until golden
      brown
      on both sides and cheese is melted, 5 to 6 minutes, flipping half way through.</li>
  </ol>
